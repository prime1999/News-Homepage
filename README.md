# News homepage

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this solution to my first challenge from front-end coding challenge (https://www.frontendmentor.io).

**This challenge was built using HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this news website homepage and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Toggle the mobile menu (done with css)
